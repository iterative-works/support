/** We need a generic Color model that can be used both on server and on client.
  *
  * We have adopted the Tailwind model for now. There is nothing inherently
  * Tailwind-specific in the implementation, but all the values are taken from
  * their palette and the area model is very HTML biased.
  *
  * Still, I think that it is a good starting point for exploration and will
  * satisfy our current needs.
