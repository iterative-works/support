# Code Review: Phase 04 - CI runs test suite on PR

**Issue:** SUPP-9
**Phase:** 4
**Reviewer:** Claude
**Date:** 2026-01-30

## Summary

- **Critical Issues:** 0
- **Warnings:** 0
- **Suggestions:** 1

## Findings

### Suggestions

1. **[S1] Consider workflow artifact caching for tests**
   - File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - The test job could potentially benefit from caching compiled artifacts from the compile job
   - However, this is a Phase 5 optimization concern (parallel jobs and caching)
   - For now, the conservative approach (recompile in test job) is acceptable

## Conclusion

The implementation follows the established pattern from existing jobs exactly. The test job:
- Correctly depends on compile job
- Uses identical infrastructure setup
- Runs the appropriate Mill command

**Verdict:** APPROVED - No critical or warning issues.
